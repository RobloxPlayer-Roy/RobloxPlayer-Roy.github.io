        <h2>February 14, 1932</h2>
        <p>Today marks the beginning of my journey as a soldier. I'm only 16, but with the war raging on and Osmar desperate for more men, I had no choice but to join. It feels strange to wear this uniform, the heavy boots and stiff cap. My name is now Private Thomas Twain, but I still feel like the same farm boy from the countryside.
            No one really knows who started this war. Some say it was Afrar; others claim it was a misunderstanding that spiraled out of control. All I know is that we are fighting the Afrar, and they are the enemy. My heart aches thinking of the friends and family I left behind, but I believe we are on the right side, the good side.
            The training was grueling. We were pushed to our limits, both physically and mentally. I've never been so tired, nor so scared. There are men here much older and stronger than me, yet the fear in their eyes is the same. War spares no one, and it's hard to ignore the uncertainty of survival.
            I met a few others in my platoon today. They seem like good men, and some are just as young as me. There's Jack, who used to be a baker, and Sam, who left behind a wife and two children. Their stories are different, but the hope in their eyes is the same. We all want to go back to our lives, to the normalcy we once knew.
            I write this by the light of a dim candle, the sounds of distant gunfire echoing in the night. It's hard to sleep, knowing what lies ahead. Tomorrow, we march to the front lines. I've heard stories of the battles there, of the horrors and the bravery. I pray that I find the courage within me to face whatever comes.
            This is my first entry. I hope there will be many more, and that one day I'll read these pages in a peaceful, free Osmar. But for now, all I can do is take it one day at a time and fight for my country, for my people.
